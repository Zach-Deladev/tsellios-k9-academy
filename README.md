### Structure

## **Existing Features**

### **Navigation:**

1. Every page has a simple yet effection Navigation bar that is transparent but transitions to black on the scroll of the page to stop content overlap.

![Navigation](assets/images/readme/nav-image.png "Navigation")

2. The navigation bar is also responsive and collapses on smaller screen sizes into a "burger" menu to keep the design clean and simple.

3. I implemented a hover effect when the user highlights a menu item to give the navigation menu an interactive feel.

4. I also added an orange background to the "contact us" menu item to divert the user's attention to the contact page. On smaller screens where the menu collapses, I added an alert above the navbar to have the same desired outcome.

### **Header:**

1. Every page has a consistent header with an H1 element and a background image.

### **Body:**

1. Every page follows the same content structure:
    
    - The website's text containers have an RGBA transparent background which helps the text stand out from the background image giving a clear contrast and making the text easy to read.
    - Each section of the content is clearly defined with a new heading making the flow of information easy to follow.
    - Each page divides the text with either images or videos to keep the user's attention for longer. 

### **Footer:**

1. Every page has the same styled footer:

    - The footer includes interactive social media icons to guide the user to the respective social media profiles.
    - The footer also has quick links to the site's different pages so the user can quickly navigate the site.
    - The footer is responsive on all screen sizes.


### **index.html *"Page"*:**
1. Hero marketing video to instantly engage the user:
    - This video covers 80% of the viewport height leaving 20% of the section below slightly visible to make the user aware that there is the content underneath.
    - I added greyscale to the video to make the content on top stand out and to make sure there's a clear contrast between the background and the content.

2. Social media icons to direct the user to the social media pages to build an online following:

    - Keeping in line with the business goals and chosen colour palette I used a subtle orange border around the social media icons to direct the user's attention.
    - To make the user feel engaged with the site I added hover effects to the icons so they change colour when the cursor hovers over them.
    - Each Social media icon links directly to the business owner's respective social media profiles in a separate browser tab so the user does not lose their position on the page within the website.
    

3. Business heading and title:

    - The heading was made using a Jumbotron and gives a short but descriptive overview of the business.

![index.html](assets/images/readme/index-image.png "index.html")

4. Testimonials section:

    - The testimonials section helps the user decide on their first impressions of whether the company is reputable or not.
    - The testimonials on the site are real-life testimonials for the business provided by the business owner.
    - The testimonials are a custom card design I created which is responsive on different screen sizes.
    - To keep in line with the colour palette I added a background colour or orange to them.
